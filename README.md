Network-Wide Patch Management System

## Overview 
The Network-Wide Patch Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to automate the entire lifecycle of patch management across multiple servers within an organization. This application aims to simplify the process of ensuring that all servers are up-to-date with the latest security patches and software updates, thereby minimizing vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with security standards.
 
## Key Features 
1. Automated Patch Discovery: The system continuously monitors for new patches and updates relevant to the software and operating systems running on the network's servers. It uses various sources, including official vendor sites and security bulletins, to ensure comprehensive coverage. 
2. Patch Testing and Validation: Before deployment, patches are downloaded to a controlled sandbox environment where they are automatically tested for compatibility and stability issues. This feature helps prevent the deployment of problematic patches that could disrupt services. 
3. Staged Rollouts: The system supports staged patch deployment, allowing administrators to deploy patches to a small percentage of servers initially, then gradually extend coverage. This phased approach helps in identifying potential issues with minimal impact. 
4. Compliance and Vulnerability Reporting: Generates detailed reports on the patch status of all servers, highlighting any vulnerabilities due to missing patches. It also tracks compliance with internal and external security standards, providing evidence for audits. 
5. Rollback Capabilities: In case a patch causes issues post-deployment, the system can automatically rollback the server to its pre-patch state, minimizing downtime and service disruption. 
6. Custom Patch Policies: Administrators can define custom patch policies, specifying which types of patches (security, software updates, critical updates) are automatically approved for deployment and which require manual approval. 
7. Notification and Alerts: The system sends real-time notifications and alerts to administrators about critical patches, patch deployment progress, and any issues encountered during the patch management process. 
8. User-Friendly Dashboard: A central dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the patch management process, including patch availability, deployment status, compliance levels, and historical analytics on patching activities.
